# Cognifyz Java Projects Level 1
Unlocked Level 1! Just wrapped up all 4 tasks with a bow on my Java Development Internship at Cognifyz Technologies.

# Task 1 - Temperature Converter
It effortlessly converts temperatures between Celsius and Fahrenheit. So, you're prompted to just pop in a temperature value and tell it whether it's in Celsius or Fahrenheit. And bam! It does the conversion trick and gives you the converted temperature.

# Task 2 - Palindrome Checker
Imagine having a program that can tell you whether a word or phrase is a palindrome. You know, a palindrome is something like "racecar" or "madam," which reads the same forwards and backwards. The cool part is, this program would ignore spaces and punctuation, so "A man, a plan, a canal, Panama!" would also be recognized as a palindrome.

# Task 3 - Student Grade Calculator 
It's pretty handy for calculating and showing the average grade of a student. It prompts you to enter how many grades you want to calculate the average for. Once you've entered that, you can input each of the grades. The program then does its magic and calculates the average for you.

# Task 4 - Random Password Generator 
A cool program that creates random passwords. You tell me the length and what to include (Numbers, Lowercase/Uppercase Letters, Special Characters), and it'll make the password for you.
